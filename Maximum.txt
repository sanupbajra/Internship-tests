Let’s look at a very simple algorithm called find_max().

Problem: Given a list of positive numbers, return the largest number on the list.

Inputs: A list L of positive numbers. This list must contain at least one number. 

Outputs: A number n, which will be the largest number of the list.

Algorithm:

Set max to 0.
For each number x in the list L, compare it to max. If x is larger, set max to x.
max is now set to the largest number in the list.
